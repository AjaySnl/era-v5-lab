# Licence table and strategy v0

Shared G10 licence file (`teams/10-post-training/licences/licence_table.md`).

## Team workflow (Core Team · 12 members)

- Keep this **one shared file** (`teams/10-post-training/licences/licence_table.md`).
- Give it **one section for each dataset** (for example `StarCoder`, `Stack Exchange`, `Indic web`).
- Each of the 12 G10 Core Team members adds the licence, source, and decision (`TSAI reserves`) for their own dataset in their own section by pull request to the lead's branch (`g10-week1-post-training`).
- The team lead (Sai Teja) merges the member PRs, removes duplicates in the consolidated licence table, and opens one PR to `theschoolofai/era-v5-lab` `main`.

## Strategy v0

- **Commercial-use data only:** Any dataset or file whose licence is missing or restricts commercial use is excluded.
- **Decision authority:** `TSAI reserves` all dataset release and retention decisions.
- **Repository hygiene:** Raw Parquet files never enter `era-v5-lab`.
- **Token & effort rules:** 256 reserved special tokens (`0..255`) and four plain-text effort levels (`1k`, `4k`, `16k`, `64k`).
